Finding these dependencies usually imply that they are able to find different trends in the data and predict which the following outcomes will be. To do so, the LSTM's (and in general, RNN networks) output will depend not only on its input, but also on its current state. To ensure that this state finds the long term dependencies (across training batches) we need to implement a stateful LSTM.\n\nThese properties seem specially important for predicting different pollution levels. This task, which is basically time series forecasting, is a good fit for LSTM and they are probably able to find different trends to predict from one day to the other. Using LSTMs will make it possible not to only use the recent training data, but also explore how different long-term trends may affect the forecast. Therefore, the main dataset used in this kernel will be the historical data of air pollution levels in Madrid, which has hourly data for the period 2001-2018."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"916ae706faf62c734305e7b2fe798cdc32f5a278"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport missingno as msno\n\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, TimeDistributed\nfrom keras.optimizers import RMSprop\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\nsns.set()\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ffa8cd5d9d2c34be38f019b125961a922c6f5ea0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Also, this notebook will not enter into the theorical details of how an LSTM works; it will instead focus on the implementation details of the network with Keras.

The most notable one is the difficulty that the model has to predict a sudden change of trends. It does not seem unclear, since the *one-hot* column strategy had limited results. \n\nAnother possibility is to include not only data like wind or rain levels measured, but also add the forecast: add as a new feature the forecast for the next day. That new feature would ease the learning for the network and should be able to detect a direct relation with the forecast if the data is actually relevant. Although reliable forecast are not common for traffic, wind and rain are actively being predicted. The problem is, once again, the difficulty to find suitable data: a good history of the last 18 years of hourly weather forecasts for the next day in Madrid sounds like an unicorn to me.\n\nDespite these problems, the model still presents rather interesting results. The way the predictions fit with the general shape of the real day, despite the scale being off some times can be already interesting to predict when the higher levels of pollution are expected to be encountered. Possible interesting experiments include testing other recurrent architectures to check if they actually present better results."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
